Once the feature development was completed, the branch was merged back into the main branch using Git’s merge functionality. The merge was successful, and the changes became part of the main codebase. After verifying the merge, the feature branch was deleted to keep the repository clean. This branching and merging workflow follows standard industry practices and ensures safe and efficient collaboration in software development.In this task, a new feature branch was created from the main branch using Git. The purpose of creating a separate branch was to work on changes independently without affecting the stable main branch. After switching to the feature branch, updates were made to the README file and the changes were committed with a clear and meaningful commit message. This approach helps in organizing work and maintaining a clean project history.
